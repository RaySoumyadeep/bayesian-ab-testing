The Bayesian approach to data analysis is applied across various fields such as marketing and engineering, and even includes sports and law.

In online randomized controlled experiments, specifically A/B testing, you can use the Bayesian approach in 4 steps:

1. Identify your prior distribution.
2. Choose a statistical model that reflects your beliefs.
3. Run the experiment.
4. After observation, update your beliefs and calculate a posterior distribution.
